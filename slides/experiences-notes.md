# Joyride + AI: Early Experiences

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

The Clojure REPL is the real cure for AI hallucinations, because the application under development (in this case VS Code itself) will provide immidate reality check. The AI will need to adapt and try new things until they work. Mistake Driven Development. The AI hammers on the REPL, learning rapidly. Crafting solutions that are much more likely to work because of this.

The AI is a bit less stellar att pulling information from the human intelligence, HI. Though there has been some success with system prompting it to use Joyride to create prompts for the human.

### How it fits into the overall story
This slide shares the first real-world results and lessons. It’s the “proof” and the honest reflection.

### Crucial message
Live, interactive programming with Joyride and AI is powerful, but not without challenges. The REPL is key to rapid learning and real solutions.

### Extra important details
Highlight the role of the REPL in reducing AI hallucinations and enabling mistake-driven development. Mention the ongoing challenge of context management and the learning curve.

### Dramaturgic mood
Honest, encouraging, and a bit reflective. Show both the excitement and the reality.

### Narration length
Medium. Enough to share both wins and challenges.

### Hooks
Hooks into the final slide by inviting the audience to join the journey and community. The next slide introduces PEZ and the invitation.

## Narration Script

When you bring Joyride and AI together, something special happens. You build automations step by step, get instant feedback from the REPL, and see results right away. The AI learns by doing, adapting to the quirks of VS Code and Joyride. Mistakes aren’t setbacks—they’re part of the process. The REPL keeps the AI honest, turning hallucinations into real, working solutions.

Of course, there are challenges. The VS Code API is vast, and the interactive mindset takes practice. Managing context and learning to collaborate with the AI takes time. But the payoff is real: rapid iteration, fewer dead ends, and solutions that actually work.

This is just the beginning. The journey is open to everyone. And that brings us to the final chapter—an invitation to join the community.
