# Joyride + AI: Early Experiences

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

The Clojure REPL is the real cure for AI hallucinations, because the application under development (in this case VS Code itself) will provide immidate reality check. The AI will need to adapt and try new things until they work. Mistake Driven Development. The AI hammers on the REPL, learning rapidly. Crafting solutions that are much more likely to work because of this.

The AI is a bit less stellar att pulling information from the human intelligence, HI. Though there has been some success with system prompting it to use Joyride to create prompts for the human.
