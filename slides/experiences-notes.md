# Joyride + AI: Early Experiences

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

The Clojure REPL is the real cure for AI hallucinations, because the application under development (in this case VS Code itself) will provide immidate reality check. The AI will need to adapt and try new things until they work. Mistake Driven Development. The AI hammers on the REPL, learning rapidly. Crafting solutions that are much more likely to work because of this.

The AI is a bit less stellar att pulling information from the human intelligence, HI. Though there has been some success with system prompting it to use Joyride to create prompts for the human.

**Story Role**: The reality check - honest assessment that builds credibility and sets expectations.

**Crucial Message**: This works, but like any powerful tool, there's a learning curve for both human and AI.

**Key Details to Emphasize**:
- What works well: step-by-step building, REPL feedback, immediate results, great for demos
- Real challenges: AI learning patterns, API complexity, context management, mindset shifts
- REPL as "cure for AI hallucinations" - immediate reality feedback prevents drift
- "Mistake Driven Development" with AI hammering on REPL until solutions work

**Dramaturgic Mood**: Honest, reflective, building trust through transparency. Not deflating the excitement, but tempering it with reality.

**Narration Length**: 50-65 seconds - enough time for both positives and challenges without dwelling on problems.

**Connection to Previous**: Balances the meta-demonstration with practical reality.

**Hook to Next**: "Speaking of real experience, let me tell you about the person behind this" leading to credibility through PEZ's background.

**Tone Guidance**: Balanced honesty. Not "despite the challenges" but "here's what the actual experience looks like." Frame challenges as part of the interesting journey, not obstacles to overcome.

Let's be honest about what this actually feels like.

Building VS Code automations step by step works beautifully. The REPL gives immediate feedback that guides AI decisions. You see results instantly. It's perfect for live demos because everything's happening in real-time, in the actual environment.

The Clojure REPL is the cure for AI hallucinations. VS Code itself provides immediate reality checks. When the AI suggests something that won't work, the REPL says no immediately. The AI adapts, tries new approaches, learns from mistakes.

It's mistake-driven development at AI speed. The AI hammers on the REPL until solutions actually work, not just sound plausible.

The challenges are real. The AI is still learning Joyride patterns. VS Code's API is vast and complex. Managing context with REPL results takes practice. The interactive programming mindset is genuinely different from traditional development.

What we've discovered: the REPL conversation between AI and VS Code creates solutions that are much more likely to work than pure AI speculation. The feedback loop is immediate and honest.

This isn't just theory anymore. It's a working approach with real benefits and real learning curves.
