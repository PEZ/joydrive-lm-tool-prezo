## Narration Script

Let's be honest about what's working and what's still evolving in this AI-powered VS Code hacking adventure.

The wins are real and exciting. Building VS Code automations step by step with AI is incredibly satisfying. The REPL feedback actually guides AI decisions - when the AI sees immediate results, it learns and adapts quickly. And when you get immediate visual results? That feeling of watching your editor reshape itself to your will? Addictive.

And yes, it's great for live demos! *chuckle* There's something magical about showing people code executing in real-time while AI writes it.

But let's acknowledge the learning curve. AI is still learning Joyride patterns - it's getting better every day, but sometimes it needs guidance. The VS Code API is vast and complex, which can be overwhelming at first. Managing context with REPL results takes some practice, and the Interactive Programming mindset? Well, it's different from how most of us learned to code.

But here's the thing: AI as your learning partner makes the unfamiliar approachable. You're not struggling alone with documentation - you're exploring together with an intelligent companion who helps you understand as you go.

These aren't roadblocks - they're growth opportunities. And you won't be learning this alone - there's an entire ecosystem ready to support you.
