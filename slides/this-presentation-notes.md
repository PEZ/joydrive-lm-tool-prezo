# This Very Presentation!

Consider ending with: "Creating and running a presentation is possible because we're not just using VS Code, we are re-programming it, shaping it, making it ours - and the AI is right there helping us every step of the way."

- The presetation is built for being live modified and customized by you and CoPilot

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Wonder and realization** - the "aha!" moment when everything clicks

**Narration Length**: 35-45 seconds - let the amazement settle in
