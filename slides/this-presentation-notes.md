# This Very Presentation!

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

## To the Slide Narration Author

**Story Role**: The meta-proof - demonstrate the concept through the presentation itself.

**Crucial Message**: This entire presentation system was built using the approach we're describing.

**Key Details to Emphasize**:
- The presentation system itself was "Made with Joyride by CoPilot"
- AI workflow with dynamic "moods" for different tasks
- "Vibe code your tools while using them" - captures the fluid, immediate nature
- "Features need not even be saved" - fundamental shift from permanent solutions to flowing creation

**Dramaturgic Mood**: The "aha moment" - where theory becomes tangible reality. Slightly amazed but grounded.

**Narration Length**: 60-75 seconds - this is the core demonstration that needs time to sink in.

**Connection to Previous**: Shows Joyride in action, making the technical foundation concrete.

**Hook to Next**: "But let's be honest about what this is actually like" leading to real experiences.

**Tone Guidance**: Meta-narrative magic without being cute about it. The audience is experiencing the result right now - lean into that immediacy. Avoid "isn't this cool" and focus on "this is what it enables."

## Narration Script

This presentation system you're experiencing right now? Vibe-coded by PEZ and CoPilot.

The entire workflow - authoring slides, crafting narration scripts, generating voice audio, navigating between slides, playing synchronized audio - all built using the approach we just described.

PEZ asked CoPilot to build a presentation system. Then to author slides. Then to write narration scripts. Then to generate the voice you're hearing. Each step built on the previous one, modified on the fly.

The AI workflow uses what we call "dynamic moods" - different CoPilot instruction sets for different tasks. Story-author mood. Slide-narration-author mood. Audio-generator mood. Each specialized for its role in the pipeline.

This is AI interactive programming. You vibe-code your tools while using them. Need a feature? Ask for it. Don't like how something works? Change it immediately.

Some features get saved and become permanent tools. Others exist just for the moment they're needed. The choice depends on the feature and how often you'll use it.

You're not just experiencing a presentation about VS Code hacking. You're experiencing VS Code hacking in real-time.
