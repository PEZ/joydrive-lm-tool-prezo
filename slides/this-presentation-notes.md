**Story Position**: **The Meta-Demonstration** - This is where theory becomes tangible reality

**Crucial Message**: Everything we've talked about isn't theoretical - it's running right now, in the presentation you're experiencing

**Key Details**:
- "This Very Presentation" emphasizes the meta-nature - we're not just talking about it, we're doing it
- "Vibe code your tools while using them" captures the essence of Interactive Programming
- The ephemeral nature ("don't even need to be saved") shows the power of AI partnership

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Mind-blown revelation** - like the moment in a magic show when you realize how the trick works

**Narration Length**: 22-25 seconds - this is a key revelation that deserves full impact

**Hook from Previous**: "You want to see this in action? You already are!"

**Hook to Next**: "But who is the person behind this vision?"
