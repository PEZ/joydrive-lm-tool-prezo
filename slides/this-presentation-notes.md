# This Very Presentation!

Consider ending with: "Creating and running a presentation is possible because we're not just using VS Code, we are re-programming it, shaping it, making it ours - and the AI is right there helping us every step of the way."

## To the Narration Author

**Story Position**: **The Magic Made Real** - the ultimate proof that this isn't just theory

**Crucial Message**: The presentation itself IS the demonstration - they're experiencing the very thing being described

**Key Details**:
- "Vibe coded into existence" captures the organic, creative nature of Interactive Programming
- Emphasize that features don't need to be saved - AI can recreate them as needed
- The recursiveness is mind-bending - we're using the tools to explain the tools
- "Live proof of concept" positions this as immediate reality, not future promise
- The presetation is built for being live modified and customized by you and CoPilot

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Wonder and realization** - the "aha!" moment when everything clicks

**Narration Length**: 35-45 seconds - let the amazement settle in

**Hook from Previous**: "But does this actually work in practice? Let me show you something incredible..."

**Hook to Next**: "Now you might be wondering - does this work as well as it looks?"

## Narration Script

Here's the ultimate proof of concept: this very presentation you're experiencing right now was vibe-coded into existence using exactly the tools we've been talking about.

We built an AI-powered presentation system using Joyride and ClojureScript magic. Dynamic slide navigation, AI-generated voice narration, real-time audio playback, and AI-controlled, dynamic Copilot instructions - all of it coded live, iteratively, with AI as our pair programming partner.

And here's the mind-bending part: we've been modifying VS Code while presenting to you. Live VS Code hacking, happening in real-time. This is AI Interactive Programming in action!

You can vibe-code your tools while using them. Features don't even need to be saved - the AI can just build them again when you need them. Why store what you can recreate?

This presentation isn't just about the future of development - it IS that future, happening live, right now. We're not just using VS Code, we're reprogramming it, shaping it, making it ours - and the AI is right there helping us every step of the way.

You're not just watching a demo - you're experiencing the reality we've been describing.
