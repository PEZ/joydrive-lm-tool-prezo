# Story Script for the Joyride + CoPilot Presentation

## Opening: From User to Hacker

The story opens with a familiar frustration: as developers, we install countless VS Code extensions, yet our workflow never feels quite right. The promise: what if you could make VS Code truly your own, not just by installing, but by hacking it—live, as you work? Enter Joyride and CoPilot, a partnership that transforms every VS Code user into a VS Code hacker. The audience is invited to imagine a world where their editor adapts to them, not the other way around.

## Chapter 1: This Presentation—A Live Example

We begin with a demonstration: this very presentation is built with Joyride and CoPilot. Slides, narration, even the audio, are generated and controlled live. The workflow is collaborative: human and AI draft, refine, and narrate together. The system is so dynamic that new features don’t even need to be saved—CoPilot can rebuild them on demand. This is interactive programming, where your tools evolve as you use them. The audience sees the power in action before knowing the details.

## Chapter 2: What is Joyride?

Now, the curtain is pulled back. Joyride is the bridge between you and your ideal editor. It lets you script, automate, and extend VS Code in user space—while you use it. With ClojureScript as its language, Joyride enables live, interactive development. But scripting your editor used to be daunting. Now, with CoPilot as your AI pair, the barrier is gone. You can ask for automations, UI tweaks, or new features, and CoPilot will hack VS Code for you. You can learn ClojureScript at your own pace, or just let the AI do the heavy lifting.

## Chapter 3: Early Experiences—What Works, What’s Hard

Early experiments show the power of this approach. Building automations step by step, getting instant feedback from the REPL, and seeing results immediately—these are game changers. The AI learns by doing, adapting to the quirks of VS Code and Joyride. There are challenges: the VS Code API is vast, and the interactive mindset takes practice. But the payoff is real: rapid iteration, fewer hallucinations, and solutions that actually work.

## Closing: Who is PEZ?—Invitation to the Community

The story closes with an introduction to PEZ, the creator and guide on this journey. The invitation is clear: join the community of VS Code hackers. With Joyride and CoPilot, you’re not just a user—you’re a co-creator. The future of your editor is in your hands, and the adventure is just beginning.
