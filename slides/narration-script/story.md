# The VS Code Hacker Story

## The Central Story Arc

This presentation tells the story of a familiar frustration transforming into genuine empowerment. Every VS Code user knows this feeling: you've installed dozens of extensions, configured settings files, tweaked themes, and yet something still feels... not quite right. Your editor almost does what you need, but not exactly.

The story we're telling is simple: what if your AI coding assistant could fix this for you? Not with grand promises or marketing speak, but with concrete capability. Today.

## The Story Structure

### Opening Hook (Slide 1: Hello)
**The Promise**: "VS Code User â†’ VS Code Hacker"

We start with a transformation promise that every VS Code user can immediately relate to. The subtitle "Now CoPilot can script VS Code while you are using it" is the core value proposition - no fluff, just capability.

**Tone**: Direct and confident. We're not selling a dream; we're announcing a reality.

### The Foundation (Slide 2: What is Joyride)
**The Barrier Removal**: From intimidating to accessible

Here we acknowledge the honest truth - Joyride used to seem daunting. Both the concept of scripting your editor and ClojureScript being unfamiliar created barriers. But AI changes everything: "Install Joyride, ask CoPilot to hack VS Code. Iterate. That's it."

**Key Reality Check**: "Extending in user space" means you can hack VS Code while using it. The threshold is now "practically lowered to zero" - you can learn ClojureScript at your own pace while the AI does the heavy lifting immediately.

### The Proof (Slide 3: This Presentation)
**The Meta-Demonstration**: "Made with Joyride by CoPilot"

This slide serves dual purpose - it's both explanation and live demonstration. The entire presentation system was built this way. The audience is experiencing the result right now.

**Crucial Insight**: "All new features need not even be saved" - the AI can rebuild tools as needed. This shifts the mental model from "building permanent solutions" to "flowing with immediate needs."

### The Reality Check (Slide 4: Experiences)
**The Honest Assessment**: What actually works, what's still challenging

This is where we earn credibility by being honest. Yes, there are challenges. The AI is learning, VS Code's API is complex, and the mindset shift takes practice. But the REPL provides immediate reality checks that prevent AI hallucinations.

**The Key Insight**: The Clojure REPL is "the real cure for AI hallucinations" because VS Code itself provides immediate feedback. This turns development into a conversation between AI and reality.

### The Human Element (Slide 5: Who is PEZ)
**The Community Invitation**: Why should you trust this story, and how can you join?

This grounds everything in human reality while extending an invitation. PEZ isn't just sharing knowledge - he's genuinely curious about what people will build. The contact details aren't business cards; they're an invitation to join a community of VS Code hackers.

**The Personal Touch**: A working developer with a family, who sharpens kitchen knives as a hobby and has built real tools that people use daily. Someone you could actually reach out to.

## The Overarching Message

The story we're telling is fundamentally about **removing barriers**:

1. **Technical Barrier**: You don't need to learn complex APIs
2. **Time Barrier**: The AI builds tools as you need them
3. **Expertise Barrier**: Your existing VS Code knowledge is enough
4. **Permanence Barrier**: Solutions can be temporary, rebuilt when needed

## Tone and Approach

**Conversational, not promotional**: We're sharing genuine experiences, not selling a product.

**Honest about limitations**: Acknowledging challenges builds trust and sets realistic expectations.

**Show, don't tell**: The presentation system itself demonstrates the concept better than any description could.

**Technical but accessible**: We respect the audience's intelligence while making concepts approachable.

## The Ending

The presentation should end with the audience feeling: "I want to try this, and I know where to start." Not just "This seems doable," but "I'm curious what I could build, and here's someone who wants to hear about it."

The final message shifts from invitation to community: "Join the VS Code hackers. We're curious what you'll create."
