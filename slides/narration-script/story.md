# Story Script for Slide Narration

## Opening: Welcome, VS Code Hacker

The story opens with a direct invitation: not just to use VS Code, but to *own* it. The audience is welcomed as hackers—creators, not just consumers. The message is clear: you have the power to shape your development environment, and you shouldn’t settle for “good enough.”

The problem isn’t VS Code. It’s not the extensions. The real problem is that only *you* know what you need. This presentation promises to show how you, with GitHub Copilot and Joyride, can transform your editor live, making it truly yours.

## Chapter 1: What is Joyride?

The next chapter introduces Joyride as the key to unlocking this power. Joyride is “user space scripting for VS Code”—a way to extend and customize your editor without the friction of traditional extension development. It’s not just another extension; it’s a fundamental shift in what’s possible.

With Joyride, you get:
- Full access to the VS Code API and extension host
- The ability to customize your workflow to fit your exact needs
- A Language Model REPL tool, letting Copilot hack VS Code itself
- A collaborative, interactive coding experience between human and AI

The story grounds this in reality: the very presentation you’re watching was built with these tools, by a human and Copilot, working together. This isn’t theory—it’s a live demonstration of what’s possible.

## Closing: The Invitation

The story closes with a call to action. You don’t have to wait. The tools are available now. You can start experimenting, customizing, and collaborating with AI to make your development environment truly your own. The only limit is your imagination—and your willingness to hack.

This script is designed to help the slide narrator deliver a story that is direct, empowering, and practical. Each chapter builds on the last, showing—not just telling—how Copilot and Joyride can transform the way you work in VS Code.
