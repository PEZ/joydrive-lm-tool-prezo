# Speaker Notes: User space scripting for VS Code

## To Story and Slide Narrators

This slide introduces Joyride with a direct, no-nonsense title and creates a compelling meta-moment by showcasing the very presentation system as proof of concept.

**Core Message:** Joyride enables "user space scripting" - meaning you can extend and customize VS Code without the traditional extension development process, especially powerful when combined with AI assistance.

**Key Emphasis Points:**
- **"User space scripting"** - This is the key concept - development freedom without barriers
- **"Full VS Code API + Extension host access"** - Complete power, no limitations
- **"Language Model REPL tool"** - This is revolutionary - it makes CoPilot capable of actually modifying your editor
- **"Custom AI workflow"** - Emphasize that this creates entirely new possibilities for development workflows
- **GitHub repository link** - Audience can immediately explore and experiment

**Tone:** Confident and practical. This slide should feel like opening a door to immediate possibilities - not theoretical future benefits, but tools you can use right now.

**Background Context for Narrators:**
The title "User space scripting for VS Code" is significant positions Joyride not as another extension, but as a fundamental capability shift. "User space" is a technical term that conveys freedom and direct control.

The presentation system being discussed includes slide generation, voice narration, audio playback, and presentation orchestration - all built collaboratively using Joyride as the platform for human-AI interaction.

The "Language Model REPL tool" concept is particularly important - this means CoPilot can actually execute code that modifies the editor in real-time, not just suggest static code snippets.

**Potential Clarifications:**
- "User space scripting" means you can extend VS Code without going through extension marketplaces or approval processes
- The heart emoji positioning (after the logos) suggests the love that develops from using these tools together
- "Vibe-coded" captures the iterative, experimental joy of human-AI collaboration in this new paradigm
- The GitHub link provides immediate actionability - the audience can start experimenting today. End on this call to action. We are eager to learn what you build!
