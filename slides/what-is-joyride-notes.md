# Joyride â€“ What is it?

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Joyride can hack also hack existing extensions, not just VS Code itself.

Extending in user space means hacking VS Code while it is being used.

The scripting language is ClojureScript, enabling the application to be developed and queried while it is running.

Before the AI tooling Joyride could seem a bit hard to get started with. Both because the idea of scripting your editor is a bit new to many VS Code users. But also because ClojureScript is unfamiliar to many. With CoPilot being able to do the hacking, the threshold is practially lowered to zero. Install Joyride, ask CoPilot to hack VS Code. Iterate. That's it. Then you can learn ClojureScript at your pace. To get even more out of Joyride.
