# Joyride â€“ What is it?

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Joyride can hack also hack existing extensions, not just VS Code itself.

Extending in user space means hacking VS Code while it is being used.

The scripting language is ClojureScript, enabling the application to be developed and queried while it is running.
