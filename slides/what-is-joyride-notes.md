## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

*--- End Stakeholder Input Section ---*

## To Story and Slide Narrators

**Extension Hacking Superpower**: Emphasize that Joyride can hack existing extensions, not just VS Code itself. This transforms the narrative from "throw away your extensions" to "make your extensions work perfectly together." Users have invested time in choosing extensions - validate that investment while showing how to transcend the limitations.

**Composability Over Replacement**: Frame Joyride as the meta-tool that makes existing tools work exactly as envisioned, rather than as a replacement for extensions.
