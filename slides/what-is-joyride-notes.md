# Joyride â€“ What is it?

**Key script points:**
- Lead with "imagine reshaping VS Code itself, live"
- Interactive Programming = the secret sauce
- "You're not just developing apps, you're live-coding your dev environment"
- Position ClojureScript as the enabler, not the star
- Emphasize: everything extensions can do, you can do interactively

**Hooks for VS Code users:**
- "What if your editor could evolve with your workflow?"
- The tailor-made suit metaphor
- AI integration angle - Copilot helping build custom solutions

**Avoid:**
- Deep Clojure language details
- Functional programming theory
