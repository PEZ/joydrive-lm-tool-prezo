# Joyride â€“ What is it?

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Joyride can hack also hack existing extensions, not just VS Code itself.

Extending in user space means hacking VS Code while it is being used.

The scripting language is ClojureScript, enabling the application to be developed and queried while it is running.

Before the AI tooling Joyride could seem a bit hard to get started with. Both because the idea of scripting your editor is a bit new to many VS Code users. But also because ClojureScript is unfamiliar to many. With CoPilot being able to do the hacking, the threshold is practially lowered to zero. Install Joyride, ask CoPilot to hack VS Code. Iterate. That's it. Then you can learn ClojureScript at your pace. To get even more out of Joyride.

**Story Role**: The foundation - explain the technical basis that makes the promise possible.

**Crucial Message**: Joyride provides the technical foundation; AI integration is the new superpower.

**Key Details to Emphasize**:
- Can hack existing extensions, not just VS Code itself
- "Extending in user space" means live modification while VS Code runs
- ClojureScript + REPL enables live development and querying
- Before AI: Joyride seemed hard to get started with (unfamiliar concept + unfamiliar language)
- After AI: "threshold is practically lowered to zero" - Install Joyride, ask CoPilot, iterate
- Learn ClojureScript at your own pace to get even more out of the system

**Dramaturgic Mood**: Grounding and educational. Building technical credibility without overwhelming detail.

**Narration Length**: 45-60 seconds - need time to establish the technical foundation clearly.

**Connection to Previous**: Answers "How is this possible?" from the opening promise.

**Hook to Next**: Sets up "Let me show you what this looks like in practice" leading to the presentation demo.

**Tone Guidance**: Technical but not intimidating. Think "Here's how it works" rather than "Here's why it's amazing." Let the capabilities speak for themselves.

## Narration Script

Joyride is VS Code scripting that happens in user space. That means you can hack VS Code while you're using it. No restarts, no complex development environments.

The secret is ClojureScript and its REPL. You can develop and query your VS Code extensions while they're running. Change something, see it immediately. Ask VS Code what's happening, get an answer.

Joyride has always had full access to VS Code's API and the APIs of any installed extensions. That extension that almost does what you need? Joyride can make it do exactly what you need.

Before AI assistance, getting started felt daunting. New concept, unfamiliar language. Two barriers at once.

Now? Install Joyride. Ask CoPilot to hack VS Code. Iterate until it works. The threshold dropped to practically zero.

You can learn ClojureScript at your own pace to unlock even more possibilities. Or just keep asking the AI for what you need. Either way works.

What you're seeing right now - this presentation system - was built exactly this way. Let me show you how.
