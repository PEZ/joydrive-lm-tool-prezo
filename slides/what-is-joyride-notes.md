# Speaker Notes: What is Joyride?

## To Story and Slide Narrators

This slide introduces Joyride and creates a meta-moment by revealing that this very presentation is a live example of what Joyride enables.

**Core Message:** Joyride transforms VS Code from a fixed tool into a malleable development environment that you can reshape in real-time, especially when paired with AI assistance.

**Key Emphasis Points:**
- **"User-space scripting"** - Emphasize that you don't need to go through extension publishing workflows
- **"Live development"** - This is the killer feature - REPL-driven modification of your editor while you use it
- **"Vibe-coded"** - This term captures the collaborative, experimental, and iterative nature of human-AI programming
- **Meta-commentary** - The presentation system itself demonstrates Joyride's power

**Tone:** Confident and slightly playful. This slide should feel like pulling back the curtain to show the magic behind the magic.

**Background Context for Narrators:**
Joyride is a VS Code extension that allows users to write ClojureScript code that runs directly within the VS Code environment. Unlike traditional extensions that require packaging and publishing, Joyride scripts run in "user-space" - meaning developers can write, test, and iterate on editor customizations immediately.

The presentation system being discussed was actually built using Joyride, with PEZ (Peter Str√∂mberg, creator of Calva) and GitHub Copilot working together to create slides, manage presentation flow, and even generate audio narrations.

**Potential Clarifications:**
- "Vibe-coding" refers to the improvisational, exploratory style of programming that emerges when humans and AI collaborate iteratively
- The heart emoji between Joyride and VS Code logos symbolizes the loving relationship between the tool and the user - it's about making VS Code truly yours
- The "proof" aspect is important - this isn't theoretical; the audience is experiencing a Joyride-powered presentation right now
