# Speaker Notes: User space scripting for VS Code

## To Story and Slide Narrators

This slide introduces Joyride with a direct, no-nonsense title and creates a compelling meta-moment by showcasing the very presentation system as proof of concept.

**Core Message:** Joyride enables "user space scripting" - meaning you can extend and customize VS Code without the traditional extension development process, especially powerful when combined with AI assistance.

**Key Emphasis Points:**
- **"User space scripting"** - This is the key concept - development freedom without barriers
- **"Full VS Code API + Extension host access"** - Complete power, no limitations
- **"Language Model REPL tool"** - This is revolutionary - it makes CoPilot capable of actually modifying your editor
- **"Custom AI workflow"** - Emphasize that this creates entirely new possibilities for development workflows
- **GitHub repository link** - Audience can immediately explore and experiment

**Tone:** Confident and practical. This slide should feel like opening a door to immediate possibilities - not theoretical future benefits, but tools you can use right now.

**Background Context for Narrators:**
The title "User space scripting for VS Code" is significant positions Joyride not as another extension, but as a fundamental capability shift. "User space" is a technical term that conveys freedom and direct control.

The presentation system being discussed includes slide generation, voice narration, audio playback, and presentation orchestration - all built collaboratively using Joyride as the platform for human-AI interaction.

The "Language Model REPL tool" concept is particularly important - this means CoPilot can actually execute code that modifies the editor in real-time, not just suggest static code snippets.

**Potential Clarifications:**
- "User space scripting" means you can extend VS Code without going through extension marketplaces or approval processes
- The heart emoji positioning (after the logos) suggests the love that develops from using these tools together
- "Vibe-coded" captures the iterative, experimental joy of human-AI collaboration in this new paradigm
- The GitHub link provides immediate actionability - the audience can start experimenting today. End on this call to action. We are eager to learn what you build!

## To the Slide Narration Author

**How this slide fits into the story:**
This is the “how” chapter. After the opening’s promise of empowerment, this slide delivers the tool—Joyride—that makes it real. It’s the bridge from aspiration to action.

**Crucial message:**
Joyride is not just another extension. It’s a new way to shape VS Code, with no barriers. Combined with Copilot, it lets you and the AI hack your editor live.

**Extra important details:**
- “User space scripting” means you don’t need to wait for someone else to build what you need.
- The presentation system itself is built with these tools—this is a live demo, not just a claim.
- The Language Model REPL tool is the secret sauce: Copilot can actually change your editor, not just suggest code.

**Dramaturgic mood:**
Confident, practical, and a bit revelatory. The audience should feel the door to new possibilities opening.

**Narration length:**
Medium. Take enough time to make the power and immediacy of Joyride clear, and to ground the story in the real, working demo.

**Hooks:**
Hooks from: The desire for empowerment and customization set up in the opening.
Hooks to: The call to action—start experimenting, start hacking, start collaborating with AI.


## Narration Script

So how do we become VS Code hackers? Meet Joyride.

User space scripting for VS Code. 

This isn't just another extension. Joyride gives you full VS Code API access... direct access to the extension host... the power to customize VS Code for your exact workflow.

Joyride includes a Language Model REPL tool. GitHub Copilot can actually hack VS Code itself. Not just suggest code—actually modify your editor, live.

Human plus AI, collaborative coding. Interactive development.

Want proof? The presentation system you're watching right now was vibe-coded by me and GitHub Copilot, working together through Joyride. Custom AI workflow for creating slides, narration, voice synthesis, and presenting.

This isn't theory. This is working code. Take it for a spin at the GitHub repository.

The tools are here. The only question is: what will you build?
