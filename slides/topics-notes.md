## Narration Script

Here's our roadmap to transformation. We're going to start by understanding what Joyride actually is - not just as a tool, but as a new way of thinking about your relationship with VS Code.

Then we'll explore the game-changing LM Tool integration that lets AI become your pair programming partner in reshaping VS Code itself. We'll dive into Interactive Programming with AI - where every idea can become reality in real-time.

You'll see a live demo where AI actually builds VS Code features before your eyes. We'll share honest experiences from early adopters who are already living this reality. And we'll explore how Joyride works beautifully with Calva to create an integrated powerhouse.

Finally, we'll look at where this incredible journey is heading next.

This isn't just a presentation about tools. This is your transformation story - from VS Code user to VS Code hacker.

So, what exactly IS Joyride?
