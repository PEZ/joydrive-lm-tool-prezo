# Joyride – What is it?

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Joyride can hack also hack existing extensions, not just VS Code itself.

Extending in user space means hacking VS Code while it is being used.

The scripting language is ClojureScript, enabling the application to be developed and queried while it is running.

Before the AI tooling Joyride could seem a bit hard to get started with. Both because the idea of scripting your editor is a bit new to many VS Code users. But also because ClojureScript is unfamiliar to many. With Copilot being able to do the hacking, the threshold is practially lowered to zero. Install Joyride, ask Copilot to hack VS Code. Iterate. That's it. Then you can learn ClojureScript at your pace. To get even more out of Joyride.

### How it fits into the overall story
This slide answers the curiosity built by the live demo. It explains what Joyride is and why it matters.

### Crucial message
Joyride lets you script, automate, and extend VS Code in user space, live, with ClojureScript—and now, with Copilot, anyone can do it.

### Extra important details
Mention that Joyride can hack existing extensions, not just VS Code itself. Emphasize the low barrier to entry with AI help.

### Dramaturgic mood
Revealing, empowering, and practical. Satisfy the curiosity, but keep the energy up.

### Narration length
Medium. Enough to explain the tool and its significance.

### Hooks
Hooks into the next slide by hinting at real-world results and challenges: "What happens when you actually use this?" The next slide shares early experiences.

## Narration Script

Joyride is the bridge between you and your ideal editor. It lets you script, automate, and extend VS Code in user space—while you use it. With ClojureScript as its language, Joyride enables live, interactive development. But scripting your editor used to be daunting. Now, with Copilot as your AI pair, the barrier is gone. You can ask for automations, UI tweaks, or new features, and Copilot will hack VS Code for you. You can learn ClojureScript at your own pace, or just let the AI do the heavy lifting.

And it’s not just VS Code itself—Joyride can even hack existing extensions. The threshold is practically zero: install Joyride, ask Copilot to hack VS Code, and iterate. That’s it. The power is in your hands, and the possibilities are wide open.

But what happens when you actually use this? Let’s look at some early experiences.
