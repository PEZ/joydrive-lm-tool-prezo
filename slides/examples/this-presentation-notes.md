# This Very Presentation!

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

The presentation AI workflow:

```
Human has a story to share
     ↓
🤝 Human + slide-author → Draft slides & notes
     ↓ (human feedback & iteration)
📖 story-author → Retrofits with storytelling expertise
     ↓ (human feedback & story refinement)
🎙️ slide-narration-author → Crafts narration scripts
     ↓ (human feedback & narration polish)
🔊 audio-generator → Generates high-quality voice audio
     ↓ (human feedback & audio refinement)
✨ Final Presentation

### How it fits into the overall story
This is the first chapter after the intro. It demonstrates, live, what Joyride and Copilot can do—building the presentation itself. It’s the “show” before the “tell.”

### Crucial message
The tools being presented are not just theory—they are powering this very presentation, live and interactively.

### Extra important details
Highlight the collaborative workflow between human and AI, and the dynamic, on-demand nature of the system.

### Dramaturgic mood
Excited, a bit magical, but grounded in reality. Let the audience feel the immediacy and power.

### Narration length
Medium. Enough to walk through the workflow and spark curiosity about how it works.

### Hooks
Hooks into the next slide by making the audience want to know: "What is this tool that makes this possible?" The next slide will explain Joyride.

## Narration Script

This presentation isn’t just about Joyride and Copilot—it’s built with them, live. Every slide, every narration, even the audio, is generated and controlled right here, as we go. Human and AI draft, refine, and narrate together. The workflow is so dynamic that new features don’t even need to be saved—Copilot can rebuild them on demand.

This is interactive programming in action. Your tools evolve as you use them. The power isn’t theoretical—it’s right in front of you, shaping this very moment.

So, how is this possible? Let’s pull back the curtain and see what makes it work.
