# Joyride: The Editor Becomes Yours

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Joyride is a VS Code extension that enables users to script and customize VS Code using ClojureScript. The key differentiator is that it operates in "user space" - meaning you can modify VS Code's behavior while actively using it, without having to develop a full extension.

ClojureScript's REPL-driven development is a perfect match for this interactive hacking style, allowing users to experiment, evaluate code, and see changes immediately.

## To the Slide Narration Author

This slide opens our story and establishes the core premise: Joyride fundamentally changes the relationship between developers and their editor. This is the "problem statement" part of our story - developers have been limited by what extensions provide, creating a gap between what they need and what they can easily implement.

**Crucial message:** Joyride removes the traditional barriers to editor customization by allowing direct interaction with VS Code's API from user space, without building a full extension.

**Important details:**
- Emphasize the immediacy - changes happen while using the editor, not after restarts
- The code example shows how simple it can be (a few lines to start interacting with VS Code)
- ClojureScript's REPL-driven workflow creates a tight feedback loop

**Dramatic mood:** Opening with a sense of possibility and empowerment - "what if you could..." - setting up the transformation from user to creator.

**Narration length:** About 45-60 seconds - this is our opening statement and needs to capture attention.

**Connection to next slide:** This slide establishes what Joyride does; the next slide will show how Copilot removes the final barrier (needing to know ClojureScript).

## Narration Script


Imagine this: every day, we open VS Code, ready to build, but always wishing it fit us just a little better. What if, instead of waiting for someone else to solve our workflow problems, we could shape the editor ourselves—live, as we work?

That’s the promise of Joyride. It’s not just another extension. It’s a new relationship with our tools. With Joyride, the wall between user and creator crumbles. We get a REPL-driven workflow, powered by ClojureScript, that lets us reach into the heart of VS Code and make it our own—without ever leaving our flow.

No more restarts. No more waiting. Every tweak, every automation, every experiment happens right here, right now. The code on this slide? That’s all it takes to start. Suddenly, the editor isn’t just a tool we use. It’s a canvas we shape, together, as a community of power users, extension authors, and AI copilots.

This is where the story begins: with the power to make VS Code truly yours.
