# Copilot + Joyride = Magic - Notes

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

This slide demonstrates the concrete possibilities and workflow. It should make the audience understand exactly how they can start using this today. The key is showing the simplicity of the interaction - just ask Copilot what you want, and it happens.

**Key Message**: This isn't theoretical - it's practical magic you can use right now. The barrier to customizing VS Code has been completely removed by AI.

**Call to Action**: By the end of this slide, the audience should want to try it immediately.

## To the Presenter

This slide should be energetic and demonstrate the concrete value. If possible, show a quick live demo or at least walk through the 4-step process with enthusiasm.

End with the Copilot quote to drive home that the AI is ready and willing to help.

This payoff slide delivers on the promise made in the opening. It's the "aha moment" where the abstract concept becomes concrete action. The audience should leave this slide feeling empowered and excited to try this immediately.

The credibility note (Calva creator) reinforces that this isn't just theory - it's built by someone who understands developer workflows deeply.

The combination of Copilot and Joyride removes all barriers to customizing VS Code. You just ask for what you want, and it happens.

### Extra important details

- Show concrete examples of what's possible
- End with the empowering Copilot quote
- Mention the credibility (built by Calva creator)

### Dramaturgic mood
Exciting, empowering, almost magical. This should feel like a superpower being offered to the audience.

### Narration length
Medium to long. Give time for each capability to sink in, and really sell the revolutionary nature of this approach.

### How it hooks to the following slide
This is the final slide - it should end with clear call to action and empowerment. The audience should leave ready to try this immediately.

## Narration Script

Here's where it gets magical. **Copilot plus Joyride equals your development environment, completely customized.**

*[confident, demonstrative]*

Look at what becomes possible when you combine AI with live scripting. You can automate workflows that are uniquely yours. Customize the UI to match exactly how your mind works. Extend functionality in ways you never imagined. Debug live with interactive problem solving.

*[pause for impact]*

And here's how simple it is:

**Step one:** Ask Copilot - *"Add a timer to my status bar."*

**Step two:** Copilot codes it - ClojureScript plus the VS Code API.

**Step three:** Joyride runs it - live, in your editor.

**Step four:** You iterate - refine until it's perfect.

*[emphasis, slower pace]*

No extension marketplace hunting. No complex configurations. No waiting for someone else to build what you need. Just describe what you want, and watch your editor transform.

*[building to crescendo]*

This represents a fundamental shift. Instead of adapting to our tools, our tools adapt to us. Instead of hunting for the right extension, we create the perfect solution. The barrier between wanting something and having it in your editor... has disappeared.

*[final emphasis, personal]*

GitHub Copilot is ready to hack VS Code for you. The technology exists. The tools are available. Built by the creator of Calva - tools that empower developers to make their environment truly their own.

**The only question is: what will you build first?**
