# Joyride + Copilot: The Perfect Pair

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Before Copilot integration, Joyride had a learning curve. Even though it's powerful, users needed to know ClojureScript or be willing to learn it. Now with Copilot as a Joyride LM Tool, the threshold is practically zero - users can simply ask for what they want, and Copilot generates the ClojureScript code that Joyride executes.

This creates a new paradigm of "Interactive Programming" where the human expresses intent, Copilot translates that into code, and the changes happen live in the editor. The user can then provide feedback, request modifications, and iterate in real-time without needing to write code themselves.

This slide represents the climax of our story - the moment where the final barrier to customization falls. It's where we reveal the transformative power of combining Joyride with Copilot, creating a solution that's greater than the sum of its parts.

**Crucial message:** The pairing of Joyride and Copilot removes the need to know ClojureScript, making editor customization accessible to all VS Code users through natural language interaction.

**Important details:**
- The concept of "Interactive Programming" - a three-way conversation between human, AI, and editor
- Solving "your exact problems" - the personalization angle that makes this relevant to each individual user
- The unintended benefit of learning ClojureScript naturally by observing Copilot's solutions

**Dramatic mood:** Revelation and excitement - this is the "aha!" moment where everything comes together and new possibilities emerge.

**Narration length:** About 60-75 seconds - this is our most important slide and deserves extended treatment.

**Connection to previous slide:** The first slide established what Joyride can do but hinted at a learning curve; this slide resolves that tension by showing how Copilot eliminates that barrier.

**Call to action (implicit):** Start thinking about what customizations you've always wanted but thought were too complex to implement.

## Narration Script


Now, let’s take it further. For years, the last barrier to true editor customization was knowing how to code it. Even with Joyride, you needed to speak ClojureScript. But what if you could just… ask?

That’s what happens when Copilot joins the story. Suddenly, the threshold drops to zero. You describe what you want—“Show me how many lines I’ve written today”—and Copilot writes the ClojureScript for you. Joyride runs it instantly. The result? Your editor bends to your will, in real time, through a conversation.

This isn’t just convenience. It’s a new paradigm: interactive programming, where human intent, AI translation, and live code execution form a feedback loop. You see the code, you see the effect, and—almost by accident—you start to learn the language of your editor.

No more waiting for the perfect extension. No more wishing someone else would solve your problem. With Joyride and Copilot, the power to shape your workflow is always at your fingertips. The editor becomes a living, evolving partner—one that finally fits you.
