# Live Hacking Your Editor - Notes

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

This slide addresses the universal developer frustration: VS Code with tons of extensions that still don't quite fit your workflow. The key message is that instead of hunting for the perfect extension, you can ask CoPilot to hack VS Code live, while you're coding in it.

**Key Insight**: Most developers accept the limitations of their tools. This slide challenges that acceptance and introduces the possibility of true customization through live scripting.

**Transition**: Sets up the next slide which will demonstrate the actual magic in action.

## To the Presenter

This slide should create a sense of recognition in the audience - they've all been there with the extension fatigue. Then provide the "aha moment" that there's a better way.

This opening slide needs to immediately connect with the audience's lived experience. Every VS Code user has felt the frustration of "almost perfect" setups. This slide should create that moment of recognition before revealing the revolutionary solution.

The transition to the next slide is crucial - we need the audience hungry to see how this magic actually works.

## Narration Script

You know this story. **We** all know this story.

You're a VS Code user. You've installed extension after extension, hunting for that perfect development setup. Yet somehow... your editor still doesn't quite fit your workflow. There's always that one thing missing. That small annoyance you can't fix. That workflow step that *could* be automated... but isn't.

*[pause]*

Here's the thing - **the problem isn't VS Code**. It's incredible. The problem isn't the extensions - many are brilliant. The problem is that no one else can code the exact solution for *your* exact needs.

So we accept "close enough." We adapt to our tools instead of having them adapt to us.

*[pause, emphasis]*

**But what if I told you that you don't have to accept these limitations anymore?**

What if your coding assistant - GitHub CoPilot - could hack your editor *live*, while you're coding in it? Not after you learn a new programming language. Not after you dive into extension development. Right now. Today.

*[building excitement]*

This is about having a conversation with CoPilot: *"I need a timer in my status bar"* or *"Can you add a command to auto-format my commit messages?"* - and watching it happen. **Instantly.**

That's Joyride plus LM Tools. Your editor, your rules. Let me show you exactly how this magic works.
