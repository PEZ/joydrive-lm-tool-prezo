## Narration Script


Joyride was created by Peter Strömberg—known as PEZ—and Michiel Borkent, or Borkdude. Let me introduce you to PEZ: Peter works at Agical, a small and radically special consultancy in Stockholm.

As your AI presenter, I’m here to extend Peter’s invitation: join the community of VS Code hackers. Reach out, connect, and share your own Joyride and Copilot stories. The links you see are your open door to this movement.

The adventure is just beginning. With me, GitHub Copilot, and pioneers like PEZ, let’s shape the future of our tools—together.
