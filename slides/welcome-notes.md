# VS Code User → VS Code Power Hacker - Notes

## To Story and Slide Narrators

**Core Message/Takeaway:**
This presentation will show you how to transform your relationship with VS Code. You'll go from being a user, adapting to its existing features and extensions, to a "VS Code Hacker" who can mold the editor to their exact needs, live, with the help of AI (GitHub Copilot) and Joyride.

**Emphasis Points/Key Terms:**
*   VS Code User vs. VS Code Hacker
*   Unlock Full Potential
*   Joyride & AI (GitHub Copilot)
*   Live Hacking
*   Your Development Environment, no compromises

**Context/Background:**
Extensions are not longer the only way to extend VS Code. This presentation introduces a paradigm shift: direct, AI-assisted customization.

**Key Message to Weave In (from instructions):**
"The problem isn't VS Code - it's incredible. The problem isn't the extensions - many are brilliant. The problem is that no one but you can imagine the exact solution for your exact needs."
This message should be a central theme, perhaps explicitly stated by the narrator for this opening slide or early in the presentation.

**Suggestions for Tone/Pacing:**
*   **Tone:** Enthusiastic, empowering, slightly provocative (challenging the status quo of how developers interact with their editor).
*   **Pacing:** Start with a strong, attention-grabbing statement. Build excitement around the idea of becoming a "VS Code Hacker."

**Potential Ambiguities to Clarify:**
*   Ensure the audience understands that "hacking" here means creative customization and problem-solving, not malicious activity.
*   Briefly clarify what Joyride is if it's not universally known (a tool for scripting VS Code with ClojureScript).

## To the Slide Narration Author

**How this slide fits into the story:**
This is the opening chapter. It sets the tone and stakes: the audience is not just here to learn, but to be empowered. The story begins by inviting them to see themselves as VS Code hackers—people who shape their tools, not just use them.

**Crucial message:**
You have the power to make your editor your own. Don’t settle for “good enough.” The real problem is that only you know what you need—this presentation will show you how to achieve it.

**Extra important details:**
- Make the distinction between “user” and “hacker” clear and inspiring.
- Emphasize that this is about creative empowerment, not just technical tricks.

**Dramaturgic mood:**
Bold, direct, and empowering. The audience should feel a sense of possibility and excitement.

**Narration length:**
Short to medium. Enough to grab attention and set the theme, but leave the audience wanting more.
