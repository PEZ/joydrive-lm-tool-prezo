# Who is PEZ?

**PRESENTATION SCRIPT, NO NEED TO AUTHOR ANYTHING ELSE:**

"Peter Strömberg is co-creator of Joyride, which he built together with the amazing Michiel Borkent.

Peter stays in his favorite editor (yes, VS Code) as much as he can, it is his operating system and digital home. Joyride is making this possible in ways many Emacs users would recognize and take for granted.

Peter is also a huge fan of Clojure, and created Calva, a Clojure Interactive Programming  extension for VS Code.

His employer, and open source patreon, is Agical, a small and very special software consultancy in Stockholm.

Let's explore what Peter has cooked for us this time."

## Narration Script

Meet Peter Strömberg - but everyone calls him PEZ. He's a father of five, husband, and someone who sharpens kitchen knives for fun. But more importantly for us today, he's the co-creator of Joyride, which he built together with the amazing Michiel Borkent.

PEZ lives in VS Code. It's not just his editor - it's his digital home, his operating system, his thinking space. Joyride is what makes this possible in ways that many Emacs users would recognize and take for granted. He's proven that VS Code can be *that* editor - the one that bends to your will.

He's also a huge Clojure fan and created Calva, the Clojure Interactive Programming extension for VS Code that brings the magic of REPL-driven development to our beloved editor.

His employer and open source patron is Agical, a small and very special software consultancy in Stockholm that believes in supporting developers who push boundaries.

So let's explore what this VS Code wizard has cooked up for us this time.
