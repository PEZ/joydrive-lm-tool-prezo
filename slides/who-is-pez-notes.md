# Who is PEZ?

## Narration Script

Meet Peter Str√∂mberg - but everyone calls him PEZ. He's a father of five, husband, and someone who sharpens kitchen knives for fun. He's the co-creator of Joyride, which he built together with the amazing Michiel Borkent.

PEZ _lives_ in VS Code. It's not just his editor - it's his digital home, his operating system, his thinking space. Joyride is what makes this possible for him, in ways that many Emacs users would recognize . Joyride is his proof that VS Code can be *that* editor - the editor that bends to your will.

He's also a huge Clojure fan and created Calva, a Clojure Interactive Programming extension for VS Code.

His employer and open source patron is Agical, a small and very special software consultancy in Stockholm that believes in supporting developers who push boundaries.

So let's explore what this VS Code homie has cooked up for us this time.
