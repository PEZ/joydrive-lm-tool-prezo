## To the Slide Narration Author

**Story Role**: The human credentials - establish trust through relatable expertise and authentic personality.

**Crucial Message**: This comes from a working developer with real-world experience, not a theorist or marketer.

**Key Details to Emphasize**:
- Working developer with family (relatable, grounded)
- Creator of Calva - established VS Code extension expertise
- "EDC: VS Code + Clojure" - this is his daily working environment
- Agical as "radically special consultancy" - suggests innovative but practical approach
- Hobby of sharpening kitchen knives - unexpected detail that humanizes

**Dramaturgic Mood**: Grounded, personable conclusion. Establishing human credibility after technical demonstration.

**Narration Length**: 40-55 seconds - personal enough to build connection, brief enough to maintain focus on the main message.

**Connection to Previous**: After discussing real experiences, here's the real person with the experience.

**Hook to Next**: N/A (closing slide) - but should leave audience with: "This is someone I could learn from AND reach out to. I'm curious what I could build, and he's curious to hear about it."

**Tone Guidance**: Warm but not overly familiar. Highlight the blend of technical expertise and human relatability. The knife-sharpening hobby is perfect - it shows someone who cares about craft and precision in unexpected areas. Frame contact details as community invitation, not business networking.

## Narration Script

Peter Str√∂mberg - most people call him PEZ. He's a working developer with a wife and five kids, which means he really needs his tools to work efficiently.

His everyday carry is VS Code plus Clojure. He built Calva, the Clojure extension that thousands of developers use daily. So when he talks about extending VS Code, he's not theorizing - this is his daily work environment.

He works at Agical, a small but radically special software consultancy in Stockholm. When he's not coding, he sharpens kitchen knives. Both hobbies are about precision, craft, and making tools work exactly as they should.

He's sharing all this because he's genuinely curious about what you'll build. These contact details aren't business cards - they're an invitation to join a community of VS Code hackers.

Try Joyride with your AI assistant. Build something that makes your development environment truly yours. Then tell him about it. He wants to hear what problems you solve, what automation you create, what workflows you improve.

The barrier between VS Code user and VS Code hacker just disappeared. He's curious what you'll create on the other side.

Join the VS Code hackers. We're excited to see what you'll build.
