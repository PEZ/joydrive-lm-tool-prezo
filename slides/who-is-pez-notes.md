## To the Story Author

**Story Position**: **The Personal Connection and Call to Action** - This is the actual closing that invites connection and community

**Crucial Message**: Behind this technology is a passionate human who lives this vision daily - and you can connect with him and join this journey

**Key Details**:
- "Father of five" humanizes the technical presenter
- "Lives in VS Code" shows this is personal, not just professional
- The social links aren't just contact info - they're doorways to the community
- This IS the call to action - framed through personal connection rather than abstract invitation

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Warm invitation and personal connection** - like meeting someone passionate who you want to stay in touch with

**Narration Length**: 18-20 seconds - this is the closing, so give it proper weight

**Hook from Previous**: "Let me introduce the person who made this possible"

**Hook to Next**: N/A (this is the closing slide) - but end with clear invitation to connect
