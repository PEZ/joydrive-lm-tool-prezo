# Who is PEZ?

**PRESENTATION SCRIPT:** (Use verbatim)

"Hi everyone! Let me introduce Peter Str√∂mberg, but you probably know him as PEZ, the Rich Hickey fan boy who never stops yapping about Clojure and Interactive Programming.

He's the creator of Calva - a Clojure VS Code extension.

Peter is also co-creator of Joyride, which he built together with the amazing Michiel Borkent - who you may know as borkdude.

His patron is Agical, a small and special software consultancy in Stockholm.

And yes, he really does have five kids and sharpens his kitchen knives as a hobby! (When he's not hacking in Clojure.)"

**Script approach:**
- Personal connection with community identity
- Establish credibility through Calva and Joyride
- Credit collaborator (borkdude)
- Mention Agical patronage
- Light humor about family and hobbies
