# Who is PEZ?

**PRESENTATION SCRIPT, NO NEED TO AUTHOR ANYTHING ELSE:**

"Peter Str√∂mberg is co-creator of Joyride, which he built together with the amazing Michiel Borkent.

Peter stays in his favorite editor (yes, VS Code) as much as he can, it is his operating system and digital home. Joyride is making this possible in ways many Emacs users would recognize and take for granted.

Peter is also a huge fan of Clojure, and created Calva, a Clojure Interactive Programming  extension for VS Code.

His employer, and open source patreon, is Agical, a small and very special software consultancy in Stockholm.

Let's explore what Peter has cooked for us this time."
