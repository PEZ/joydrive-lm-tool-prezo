## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

* **Joyride**:
  * Provides a REPL with scripting access to VS Code
  * Gives the _AI_ access to its REPL
  * Contributes commands to access the REPL
    * Useful for e.g. Keyboard shortcuts
* **Calva**: Clojure development for VS Code
  * Connects _you_ to the Joyride REPL
  * Rich Clojure tooling
* **Backseat Driver**: Additional Clojure AI tools
  * Disable Backseat Driver's eval tool when using both
  * Privides the _AI_ with Clojure tooling

## To Story and Slide Narrators

**Extension Ecosystem Insight**: This slide demonstrates the principle of extension composability in action.

**Maturity Honesty**: Be transparent about maturity levels - Calva and core Joyride are battle-tested and stable, while the LM Tool integration and Backseat Driver are brand new and rapidly evolving.
