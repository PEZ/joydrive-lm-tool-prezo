**Story Position**: **The Philosophical Foundation** - Why CoPilot + Interactive Programming changes everything about development environments

**Crucial Message**: This isn't just about better code suggestions - it's about Interactive Programming as a fundamentally different way of thinking about CoPilot's role

**Key Details**:
- The interrobang (â€½) symbol captures the "wait, CoPilot can DO that?!" moment perfectly
- "AI agents that can build VS Code features" is the core transformation promise - CoPilot evolves from assistant to builder
- Connect this to the power of functional programming and immediate feedback if appropriate for audience

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Philosophical excitement** - like the moment when a deeper truth about CoPilot's potential becomes clear

**Narration Length**: 18-20 seconds - this is the conceptual heart of the CoPilot transformation

**Hook from Previous**: "Because when CoPilot meets Interactive Programming, something revolutionary happens"

**Hook to Next**: "So what exactly is this Joyride thing that unlocks CoPilot's superpowers?"
