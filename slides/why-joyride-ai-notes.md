**Story Position**: **The Philosophical Foundation** - Why this approach changes everything about development environments

**Crucial Message**: This isn't just about automation - it's about Interactive Programming as a fundamentally different way of thinking about AI assistance

**Key Details**:
- The interrobang (â€½) symbol captures the "wait, what?!" moment perfectly
- "AI agents that can build VS Code features" is the core transformation promise
- Connect this to Rich Hickey's philosophy of data-oriented programming if appropriate for audience

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Philosophical excitement** - like the moment when a deeper truth becomes clear

**Narration Length**: 18-20 seconds - this is the conceptual heart of the presentation

**Hook from Previous**: "Because when AI meets Interactive Programming, something magical happens"

**Hook to Next**: "So what exactly is this Joyride thing we keep mentioning?"
