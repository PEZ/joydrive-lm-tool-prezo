- Turn ideas into working VS Code features immediately

**Story angle:**
- From static tools to dynamic, AI-assisted environment building

## Narration Script

Here's where everything clicks together. Remember that "almost does what I want" feeling? That's about to become ancient history.

What if Copilot could help you customize VS Code for your exact workflow? What if every time you thought "I wish VS Code did this differently," you could just ask your AI assistant to make it happen?

This is Interactive Programming meets AI assistance. Real-time, collaborative IDE customization where you describe what you want, and AI helps you build it immediately. No more waiting for feature requests, no more hunting for extensions that sort-of do what you need.

Imagine AI agents that can actually build VS Code features while you work. Picture immediate feedback as you refine your perfect development environment. Think about the power of functional programming combined with AI assistance, creating solutions you never thought possible.

This isn't just about automation - it's about transformation. From being constrained by static tools to wielding dynamic, intelligent environment building. From accepting what someone else decided VS Code should be, to creating what VS Code *could* be for you.

The question mark on this slide says it all: "What impossible thing will we build next?"
