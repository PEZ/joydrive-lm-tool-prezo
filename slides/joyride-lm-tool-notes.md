The Joyride REPL is the real cure for AI hallucinations, because the application under development, VS Code itself, will provide immidate reality check. The AI will need to adapt and try new things until they work. And, boy, does it. It hammers on the REPL, learning rapidly. Failure Driven Development. It crafts solutions that are much more likely to work because of this.
