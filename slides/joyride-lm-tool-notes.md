# The Joyride LM Tool: `joyride_evaluate_code`

## To the Narration Author

**Story Position**: **The Magic Bridge** - where possibility becomes accessible reality

**Crucial Message**: This tool doesn't just let AI read about VS Code - it lets AI *become* part of VS Code, executing code and seeing results

**Key Details**:
- "AI â†” VS Code" bridge metaphor is crucial - emphasize bidirectional communication
- Safety features aren't restrictions, they're smart design - user stays in control
- Interactive Programming Flow should sound like a conversation between human, AI, and editor
- The transparency of code execution builds trust

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Controlled excitement** - like watching a master craftsperson demonstrate their technique

**Narration Length**: 45-55 seconds - this is the technical heart that needs clear explanation

**Hook from Previous**: "Now you understand the foundation - let's see how AI makes this accessible to everyone"

**Hook to Next**: "But does this actually work in practice? Don't take my word for it, let me show you ..."

## Narration Script

Meet the magic bridge: the `joyride_evaluate_code` tool. This isn't just another API call - this is how AI becomes part of VS Code itself.

Here's how the magic works: I write ClojureScript, and it executes immediately in your VS Code environment. I have full access to the VS Code API - everything from manipulating files to creating custom commands to automating your workflow. But here's the crucial part: you stay in control.

The tool requires your explicit permission. You see every piece of code before it runs. You decide when AI can execute and when it can't. This isn't about AI taking over - it's about AI becoming your collaborator.

The Interactive Programming flow is like a three-way conversation: you describe what you want, I write the ClojureScript, VS Code executes it and shows the results, then we iterate together based on what we see. Real feedback, real results, real progress.

This is transparency in action. You're not trusting a black box - you're watching the entire process unfold, understanding each step, learning as we build together.

But does this actually work in practice? Don't take my word for it, let me show you...
