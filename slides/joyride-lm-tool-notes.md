# The Joyride LM Tool: `joyride_evaluate_code`

## To Story and Slide Narrators

The Clojure REPL is the real cure for AI hallucinations, because the application under development (in this case VS Code itself) will provide immidate reality check. The AI will need to adapt and try new things until they work. And, boy, does it. It hammers on the REPL, learning rapidly. Crafting solutions that are much more likely to work because of this.

## To the Story Author

**Story Position**: **The Magic Reveal** - This is where we show the actual mechanism that makes everything possible

**Crucial Message**: The REPL is what makes AI truly intelligent about VS Code - it's the reality check that prevents hallucinations

**Key Details**:
- The technical details matter less than the *why* - emphasize the safety and transparency
- "Immediate feedback and iteration" is the key phrase - this is what changes everything
- User control is paramount - this isn't AI running wild, it's AI as a controlled partner

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Confident demonstration with emphasis on trust** - like showing someone the engine of a car before they drive it

**Narration Length**: 15-18 seconds - this is a key technical concept that needs clear explanation

**Hook from Previous**: "Here's the magic that makes it possible"

**Hook to Next**: "But why is this combination so powerful?"
