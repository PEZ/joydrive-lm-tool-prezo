## To Story and Slide Narrators

The Clojure REPL is the real cure for AI hallucinations, because the application under development (in this case VS Code itself) will provide immidate reality check. The AI will need to adapt and try new things until they work. And, boy, does it. It hammers on the REPL, learning rapidly. Crafting solutions that are much more likely to work because of this.

## To the Story Author

**Story Position**: **The Magic Reveal** - This is where we show the actual mechanism that transforms CoPilot from code assistant to VS Code hacker

**Crucial Message**: The REPL is what makes CoPilot truly intelligent about VS Code - it's the reality check that turns suggestions into working automations

**Key Details**:
- The technical details matter less than the *why* - emphasize how this transforms CoPilot's capabilities
- "Immediate feedback and iteration" is the key phrase - this is what evolves CoPilot from passive to active
- User control is paramount - this isn't CoPilot running wild, it's CoPilot as a controlled, intelligent partner

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Confident demonstration with emphasis on trust** - like showing someone the engine upgrade that transforms their car

**Narration Length**: 15-18 seconds - this is a key technical concept that needs clear explanation

**Hook from Previous**: "Here's the breakthrough that transforms CoPilot"

**Hook to Next**: "But why is this CoPilot + Interactive Programming combination so revolutionary?"
