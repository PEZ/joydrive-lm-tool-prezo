# Joyride + LM Tools

**PRESENTATION SCRIPT - USE VERBATIM:**

"Welcome everyone! If you're a VS Code user - and I'm guessing most of you are - this presentation is specifically for you.

Raise your hand if you've ever found yourself thinking 'VS Code almost does exactly what I want, but not quite.' Well, what if I told you that's about to change forever?

Today we're going to explore Joyride plus LM Tools - a combination that will transform how you think about your development environment. Your editor will never feel the same again.

We're going to discover something called Interactive Programming - a programming paradigm that most developers don't even know exists. And it's this paradigm that's going to unlock incredible possibilities for customizing and automating VS Code in ways you never imagined.

So buckle up, because we're about to hack VS Code itself!"

**Why this script works:**
- Direct VS Code user targeting with immediate relevance
- Relatable pain point that hooks the audience
- Builds mystery around Interactive Programming paradigm
- Creates excitement and anticipation for what's coming
- Perfect tone: conversational but energetic
