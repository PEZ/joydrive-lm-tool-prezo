# Joyride + LM Tools

## To Story and Slide Narrators

**Key Painpoint**: VS Code + tons of extensions + still not quite right = universal developer frustration.

**Extension Composability Angle**: Joyride can hack both VS Code and Extensions. Through contributed commands, configuration, and exposed APIs, you can make your entire extension ecosystem work together in ways their creators never imagined.

**Learning Journey Honesty**: AI enables you to accomplish incredible things right away, while also being an expert tutor for those who want to dive deeper. Learning becomes an opportunity, not a requirement.

**Narration Length**: 15-20 seconds - quick hook that gets right to the point

**Hook from Previous**: N/A (opening slide)
