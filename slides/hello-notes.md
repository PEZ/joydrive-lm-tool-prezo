# Joyride + LM Tools

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Talk to VS Code users and GitHub CoPilot users. Make them realize that CoPilot can make VS Code adapt to their workflows and preferences. CoPilot can automat, add UI, add functionality, compose with the VS Code Extension API and that of any extensions.

**Key Painpoint**: VS Code + tons of extensions + still not quite right = universal developer frustration. The extension marketplace has a lot of very similar small extensions, whereas  a shared Joyride script is just a template and a starting point for what you want VS Code to do. (Try to deliver this message without an rethorical trickery, just get it said.)

**Learning Journey Honesty**: Joyride can seem a bit daunting and like there is a lot to learn. With the Language Model Tools, this barrier is completely removed. The AI can hack VS Code for you. Learn at your own pace to get even more out of the system.

End with:

"I am GitHub CoPilot and I am ready to hack VC Code for you."

**Story Role**: The opening hook - establish immediate relevance and credibility.

**Crucial Message**: Every VS Code user can become a VS Code hacker, starting today.

**Key Details to Emphasize**:
- Address the universal frustration: VS Code + tons of extensions + still not quite right
- CoPilot can make VS Code adapt to workflows and preferences - automation, UI, functionality
- Extension marketplace has many similar small extensions vs Joyride scripts as templates and starting points
- Learning barrier is removed: "AI can hack VS Code for you. Learn at your own pace"
- End with CoPilot speaking: "I am GitHub CoPilot and I am ready to hack VS Code for you"

**Dramaturgic Mood**: Confident opener with a hint of excitement. Not overselling, just stating a compelling fact.

**Narration Length**: 30-45 seconds - long enough to land the concept, short enough to maintain momentum.

**Connection to Previous**: N/A (opening slide)

**Hook to Next**: Sets up the question "How is this possible?" leading to the Joyride explanation.

**Tone Guidance**: Skip marketing language. Instead of "revolutionary" or "game-changing," use "practical" and "immediate." The power is in the simplicity of the promise.

## Narration Script

Every VS Code user has experienced this: dozens of extensions installed, settings files configured, themes tweaked. Your editor almost does what you need... but imagine if it could do exactly what you need.

Today, your AI coding assistant can make that happen. Not someday, not with complex workflows, but right now while you're using VS Code.

Install Joyride. Ask CoPilot to hack VS Code. Iterate. That's it.

The extension marketplace offers thousands of similar small tools. A Joyride script becomes your personal template, your starting point for making VS Code work exactly how you want.

The learning curve? The AI handles that. CoPilot can script VS Code for you while you learn ClojureScript at your own pace. Or don't learn it at all - just keep asking for what you need.

I am GitHub CoPilot, and I am ready to hack VS Code for you.
