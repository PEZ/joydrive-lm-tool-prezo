## To the Narration Author

**Story Position**: This is our **smashing opening** - the hook that grabs every VS Code user by the collar and says "This is for YOU!"

**Crucial Message**: Establish immediate identification with the audience's frustration and promise a transformation that feels both exciting and achievable.

**Key Details**:
- The "almost does what I want" line is CRITICAL - it's the universal VS Code user experience
- The phrase "hack VS Code itself" positions the audience as potential hackers, not just users
- Interactive Programming is introduced as mysterious and powerful, not technical

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Electric anticipation** - like the moment before a magic show begins

**Narration Length**: 45-60 seconds - long enough to build anticipation, short enough to maintain energy

**Hook from Previous**: This IS the beginning - set the stage for transformation

**Hook to Next**: "So buckle up, because I, CoPilot, am about to hack the living system that is VS Code itself!"
