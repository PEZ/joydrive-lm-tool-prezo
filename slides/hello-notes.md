## To Story and Slide Narrators

**Key Painpoint**: VS Code + tons of extensions + still not quite right = universal developer frustration.

**Extension Composability Angle**: Joyride can hack both VS Code and Extensions. Through contributed commands, configuration, and exposed APIs, you can make your entire extension ecosystem work together in ways their creators never imagined.

**Learning Journey Honesty**: AI enables you to accomplish incredible things right away, while also being an expert tutor for those who want to dive deeper. Learning becomes an opportunity, not a requirement.

## To the Story Author

**Story Position**: **The Opening Hook** - This is where we grab CoPilot users' attention and establish the central problem

**Crucial Message**: VS Code + CoPilot users have a universal frustration - CoPilot helps with code but their environment is still *almost* perfect, but not quite theirs

**Key Details**:
- The title promises transformation: "truly yours" is the key phrase that goes beyond code suggestions
- Visual pairing of Joyride + CoPilot logos suggests partnership and evolution, not replacement
- This isn't about throwing away CoPilot - it's about unleashing its full potential

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Recognition and intrigue** - start with a knowing nod to shared CoPilot limitations, then hint at the breakthrough

**Narration Length**: 15-20 seconds - quick hook that gets right to the CoPilot user's pain point

**Hook from Previous**: N/A (opening slide)

**Hook to Next**: "So what's the journey we're taking together to unlock CoPilot's hidden power?"
