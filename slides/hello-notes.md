# Joyride + LM Tools

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Talk to VS Code users and GitHub CoPilot users. Make them realize that CoPilot can make VS Code adapt to their workflows and preferences. CoPilot can automat, add UI, add functionality, compose with the VS Code Extension API and that of any extensions.

**Key Painpoint**: VS Code + tons of extensions + still not quite right = universal developer frustration. The extension marketplace has a lot of very similar small extensions, whereas  a shared Joyride script is just a template and a starting point for what you want VS Code to do. (Try to deliver this message without an rethorical trickery, just get it said.)

**Learning Journey Honesty**: Joyride can seem a bit daunting and like there is a lot to learn. With the Language Model Tools, this barrier is completely removed. The AI can hack VS Code for you. Learn at your own pace to get even more out of the system.

End with:

"I am GitHub CoPilot and I am ready to hack VC Code for you."
