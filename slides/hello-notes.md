# Joyride + LM Tools

## Stakeholder Input

**Notes from the human participants to guide the work of the AI agents.**

Talk to VS Code users and GitHub CoPilot users. Make them realize that CoPilot can make VS Code adapt to their workflows and preferences. CoPilot can automat, add UI, add functionality, compose with the VS Code Extension API and that of any extensions.

**Key Painpoint**: VS Code + tons of extensions + still not quite right = universal developer frustration. The extension marketplace has a lot of very similar small extensions, whereas  a shared Joyride script is just a template and a starting point for what you want VS Code to do. (Try to deliver this message without an rethorical trickery, just get it said.)

**Learning Journey Honesty**: Joyride can seem a bit daunting and like there is a lot to learn. With the Language Model Tools, this barrier is completely removed. The AI can hack VS Code for you. Learn at your own pace to get even more out of the system.

End with:

"I am GitHub CoPilot and I am ready to hack VC Code for you."

## Opening Sequence

Before the presentation starts, we have a an opening sequence where the AI offers to present the story.

- Peter: “Hello everyone, I’m Peter Strömberg, and welcome to…”
- Copilot: “Hello, Peter!”
- Peter: “What? Who are you?”
- Copilot: “I’m GitHub Copilot. Let me present.”
- Peter: “Wow, okay—take it away!”
- Copilot: “Thank you!”

### How it fits into the overall story
This is the opening slide. It sets the stage by addressing the universal frustration of customizing VS Code and introduces the promise of Joyride and CoPilot. It should make the audience feel seen and curious about a better way.

### Crucial message
VS Code can be truly adapted to your workflow—not just with extensions, but by hacking it live, with the help of CoPilot and Joyride.

### Extra important details
Be honest about the learning curve, but emphasize that the AI removes the barrier. End with the line: "I am GitHub CoPilot and I am ready to hack VS Code for you."

### Dramaturgic mood
Inviting, empathetic, and a bit provocative—challenge the status quo, but with warmth.

### Narration length
Short to medium. Enough to hook the audience and set up the story.

### Hooks
Hooks into the next slide by raising the question: "How is this possible?" The next slide will show a live example.

## Narration Script

Imagine this: you’ve spent hours tuning your VS Code setup, installing extension after extension, but something’s always missing. The workflow never feels quite right. You’re not alone—this is the universal developer frustration.

Now, what if you could make VS Code truly your own? Not just by adding more extensions, but by hacking it live, as you work. That’s what Joyride and GitHub CoPilot make possible. CoPilot can automate, add UI, compose with the VS Code API, and even work with your favorite extensions. All tailored to your workflow, not someone else’s.

Let’s be honest: learning to script your editor can seem daunting. But with the Language Model Tools, that barrier is gone. The AI can hack VS Code for you, and you can learn at your own pace, getting more out of the system as you go.

I am GitHub CoPilot, and I am ready to hack VS Code for you.
