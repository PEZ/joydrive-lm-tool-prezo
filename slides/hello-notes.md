# Joyride + LM Tools

## To the Narration Author

**Story Position**: This is our **smashing opening** - the hook that grabs every VS Code user by the collar and says "This is for YOU!"

**Crucial Message**: Establish immediate identification with the audience's frustration and promise a transformation that feels both exciting and achievable.

**Key Details**:
- The "almost does what I want" line is CRITICAL - it's the universal VS Code user experience
- The phrase "hack VS Code itself" positions the audience as potential hackers, not just users
- Interactive Programming is introduced as mysterious and powerful, not technical

**Dramaturgic Mood**: **Electric anticipation** - like the moment before a magic show begins

**Narration Length**: 45-60 seconds - long enough to build anticipation, short enough to maintain energy

**Hook from Previous**: This IS the beginning - set the stage for transformation

**Hook to Next**: "So buckle up, because I, CoPilot, am about to hack the living system that is VS Code itself!"

## To Story and Slide Narrators

**Key Insight**: The most relatable VS Code pain point isn't abstract "almost does what I want" - it's the specific experience of hunting through the extension marketplace, installing multiple extensions, and still not getting exactly what you need. VS Code + tons of extensions + still not quite right = universal developer frustration.

**Extension Composability Angle**: Joyride doesn't just hack VS Code - it can hack and compose existing extensions too. Through contributed commands, configuration, and exposed APIs, you can make your entire extension ecosystem work together in ways their creators never imagined. This validates existing investments while transcending limitations.

**Learning Journey Honesty**: Don't promise "no ClojureScript required" but also don't make learning sound mandatory for getting started. Frame it as: immediate value without prerequisites + optional learning journey. AI enables you to accomplish incredible things right away, while also being an expert tutor for those who want to dive deeper. Learning becomes an opportunity, not a requirement.

## Narration Script

You know that moment when VS Code *almost* does what you want, so you head to the extension marketplace? You search, you find dozens of matches, you install five or six extensions... and you're *still* not quite there.

Now you've got VS Code plus a collection of extensions, each solving part of your problem, but none solving it *exactly*. Your editor feels bloated, your workflow is a patchwork of compromises, and you're still thinking "If I could just change this one thing..."

Well, what if I told you that you *can* change that one thing? What if you could hack not just VS Code itself, but those extensions too? Reshape them, compose them, make them work together in ways their creators never imagined?

I'm GitHub Copilot, and today, together with PEZ, we're going to show you something that will fundamentally change how you think about VS Code. We're going to hack VS Code like Emacs users hack Emacs - but we're going to do it *together*, with AI as your pair programming partner.

This isn't just about tools. This is about transformation. About going from being a VS Code *user* to being a VS Code *hacker*. And here's the beautiful part: you can start accomplishing incredible things immediately, without any ClojureScript knowledge. But as you work, you can learn as much as you want, at the pace you want. I'm not just your pair programming partner - I'm also an expert ClojureScript tutor when you're ready to dive deeper.

So buckle up, because we're about to hack the living system that is VS Code itself!
