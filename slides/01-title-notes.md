# VS Code User â†’ VS Code Power Hacker - Notes

## To Story and Slide Narrators

**Core Message/Takeaway:**
This presentation will show you how to transform your relationship with VS Code. You'll go from being a user, adapting to its existing features and extensions, to a "VS Code Hacker" who can mold the editor to their exact needs, live, with the help of AI (GitHub Copilot) and Joyride.

**Emphasis Points/Key Terms:**
*   VS Code User vs. VS Code Hacker
*   Unlock Full Potential
*   Joyride & AI (GitHub Copilot)
*   Live Hacking
*   Your Development Environment, no compromises

**Context/Background:**
Extensions are not longer the only way to extend VS Code. This presentation introduces a paradigm shift: direct, AI-assisted customization.

**Key Message to Weave In (from instructions):**
"The problem isn't VS Code - it's incredible. The problem isn't the extensions - many are brilliant. The problem is that no one but you can imagine the exact solution for your exact needs."
This message should be a central theme, perhaps explicitly stated by the narrator for this opening slide or early in the presentation.

**Suggestions for Tone/Pacing:**
*   **Tone:** Enthusiastic, empowering, slightly provocative (challenging the status quo of how developers interact with their editor).
*   **Pacing:** Start with a strong, attention-grabbing statement. Build excitement around the idea of becoming a "VS Code Hacker."

**Potential Ambiguities to Clarify:**
*   Ensure the audience understands that "hacking" here means creative customization and problem-solving, not malicious activity.
*   Briefly clarify what Joyride is if it's not universally known (a tool for scripting VS Code with ClojureScript).
