## Script Content

This presentation itself is a perfect example of what we're talking about! We're using Joyride right now to power an AI presenter that can dynamically generate audio, navigate slides, and respond to your input - all while running inside VS Code. Think about it: we're literally hacking VS Code live to create a presentation system. The slides you're seeing, the audio you're hearing, even this very narration - it's all generated on-the-fly using Interactive Programming principles. This is VS Code becoming whatever we need it to be, when we need it. No external tools, no separate applications - just pure VS Code magic powered by the flexibility of Interactive Programming!

## Context

This script was generated during a live demonstration of the AI presenter system, showcasing the meta-recursive nature of using Joyride to present about Joyride itself. The script emphasizes the Interactive Programming paradigm and how it enables real-time transformation of VS Code into a dynamic presentation platform.
